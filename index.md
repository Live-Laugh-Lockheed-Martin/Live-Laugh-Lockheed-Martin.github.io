## Manoa Munchies Overview
**Project Title**: Manoa Munchies

**Main Objective**:
The core purpose of this project is to solve the challenge of navigating the wide variety of food options on the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa campus. With multiple food vendors—such as Campus Center, food trucks, Manoa Gardens, Paradise Palms, and vending machines—students often struggle to find specific types of food or track when a favorite dish is available.

The app will provide students with real-time access to menu items across all campus food locations, filtered by their food preferences. This will simplify decision-making and increase satisfaction by reducing the time and effort spent finding meals they enjoy.

**Key Points of Development for Success**:

- Create a backend system that aggregates menu data from all vendors, allowing real-time updates.

- Organize menu items by location, cuisine type, dietary tags (e.g., vegan, halal), and availability (daily/weekly).

- Users: Can create accounts, set preferences (e.g., exclude allergens, favorite cuisines), and view tailored suggestions.

- Vendors: Can log in to update their daily/weekly menus and manage their vendor profile.

- Admins: Manage user/vendor accounts and oversee system operations.

**Core App Features**

- Search functionality for cuisine types, dishes, and vendors.

- User Home Page

- Vendor Dashboard

- Admin Panel

- Create a simple and quick form for vendors to input and update their menus.

**Implemented Features**
So far, we have completed key foundational tasks for the project, including setting up user authentication and deploying the app on Vercel. We’ve also implemented the user preferences feature, allowing users to tailor their food recommendations based on dietary needs or cuisine preferences. Currently, we’re working on enabling vendors to add their menu items and set schedules for when specific dishes will be available.
